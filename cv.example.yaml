      Worked hand-in-hand with Dr. Joan Serrà on the detection of out-of-distribution using generative models.
      Implemented both the experiments and models (Glow and PixelCNN++) used in the paper "Input Complexity and
      Out-of-distribution Detection with Likelihood-based Generative Models", accepted at the International Conference
      on Learning Representations of 2020.
      I also worked on the creation of a tool to generate text-to-speech voice data sets from YouTube videos, published
      in my GitHub profile.

  - title: Input complexity and out-of-distribution detection with likelihood-based generative models
    abstract: >
      Likelihood-based generative models are a promising resource to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs which could
      compromise the robustness or reliability of a machine learning system. However, likelihoods derived from such
      models have been shown to be problematic for detecting certain types of inputs that significantly differ from
      training data. In this paper, we pose that this problem is due to the excessive influence that input complexity
      has in generative models' likelihoods. We report a set of experiments supporting this hypothesis, and use an
      estimate of input complexity to derive an efficient and parameter-free OOD score, which can be seen as a
      likelihood-ratio test akin to Bayesian model comparison. We find such score to perform comparably to, or even
      better than, existing OOD detection approaches under a wide range of data sets, models, and complexity estimates.

  - title: Problem-agnostic speech embeddings for multi-speaker text-to-speech with SampleRNN
    abstract: >
      Text-to-speech (TTS) acoustic models map linguistic features into an acoustic representation out of
      which an audible waveform is generated. The latest and most natural TTS systems build a direct mapping between
      linguistic and waveform domains, like SampleRNN. This way, possible signal naturalness losses are avoided as
      intermediate acoustic representations are discarded. Another important dimension of study apart from naturalness
      is their adaptability to generate voice from new speakers that were unseen during training. In this paper we first
      propose the use of problem-agnostic speech embeddings in a multi-speaker acoustic model for TTS based on
      SampleRNN. This way we feed the acoustic model with speaker acoustically dependent representations that enrich the
      waveform generation more than discrete embeddings unrelated to these factors. Our first results suggest that the
      proposed embeddings lead to better quality voices than those obtained with discrete embeddings. Furthermore, as we
      can use any speech segment as an encoded representation during inference, the model is capable to generalize to
      new speaker identities without retraining the network. We finally show that, with a small increase of speech
      duration in the embedding extractor, we dramatically reduce the spectral distortion to close the gap towards the
      target identities.
