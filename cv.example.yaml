      Worked hand-in-hand with Dr. Joan Serrà on the detection of out-of-distribution using generative models.
      Implemented both the experiments and models (Glow and PixelCNN++) used in the paper "Input Complexity and
      Out-of-distribution Detection with Likelihood-based Generative Models", accepted at the International Conference
      on Learning Representations of 2020.
      I also worked on the creation of a tool to generate text-to-speech voice data sets from YouTube videos, published
      in my GitHub profile.

      Obtained a scholarship from the Spanish Government to intern in the department of my choice. I chose the VEU
      department, led by Dr. Antonio Bonafonte and focused on the development of voice technologies.
      Worked under the supervision of Dr. Santiago Pascual on text-to-speech systems, publishing the paper
      "Problem-agnostic speech embeddings for multi-speaker text-to-speech with SampleRNN", accepted as an oral at the
      10th ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop.

  - title: Input complexity and out-of-distribution detection with likelihood-based generative models
    abstract: >
      Likelihood-based generative models are a promising resource to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs which could
      compromise the robustness or reliability of a machine learning system. However, likelihoods derived from such
      models have been shown to be problematic for detecting certain types of inputs that significantly differ from
      training data. In this paper, we pose that this problem is due to the excessive influence that input complexity
      has in generative models' likelihoods. We report a set of experiments supporting this hypothesis, and use an
      estimate of input complexity to derive an efficient and parameter-free OOD score, which can be seen as a
      likelihood-ratio test akin to Bayesian model comparison. We find such score to perform comparably to, or even
      better than, existing OOD detection approaches under a wide range of data sets, models, and complexity estimates.
