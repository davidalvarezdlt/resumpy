Modifying your CV every time you obtain a new diploma or publish a new article
can be tedious and time-wasting, even when using a document generator such as
LaTeX.

Resumpy transforms raw `.json` or `.yml` files into a fully-formatted
curriculum vitae in PDF. You won't have to deal with graphical/text editors or
with LaTeX code anymore, editing that main global file will be enough to obtain
your updated CV.

## How does it work
The idea behind this project is to separate the content and the template of our
_curriculum vitae_. To do so:

+ First, you must write your resume following the specified format. You can
choose to it using a `.json` file or a `.yaml` file. The only requirement is
that your document follows the schema provided in the document
`cv.schema.json`.
+ With your raw resume created, execute Resumpy as explained in the next
sections. A `.tex` file will be generated using the template of your choice.
+ That `.tex` file is finally compiled into a PDF using LaTeX and saved inside
`./generated_documents`.

## How to create your resume
There is only one rule to follow when using Resumpy: follow the syntax
provided in `cv.schema.json`. If you are not familiar with JSON validation,
please read the tutorials provided in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
Notice that the input file will be validated at the beginning and some errors
may arise if the document is not valid.

The easiest and fastest way to start is by departing from the example provided
in `cv.example.json`.

## How to execute the code
First of all, install the dependencies required by the project. You can do it
using `pip` as:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To execute the code, we must **call the module** directly using the `-m`
argument of Python. The following snippet summarizes available arguments:

```
Usage:
    python -m resumpy --cv-file <cv_file_path> --theme <theme_name> [--filename <cv_filename>] [--keep-tex]

Options:
    --cv-file <cv_file_path>    Relative or absolute path to the raw .json or .yaml resume file
    --theme <theme_name>        Name of the theme to use to generate the resume
    --filename <cv_filename>    Name of the theme of the generated resume
    --keep-tex                  Keep LaTeX files used to generate the resume

Example:
    python -m resumpy --cv-file cv.example.json --theme sitges --filename example-cv
```

**Note**: to call a module, we must either execute the command from its root
directory or have it on the `$PYTHONPATH`.

## Available themes and examples
Only two themes are available at the moment:

|Theme Name (`<theme_name>`)|Example|Source|
|-|-|-|
|Sitges (`sitges`)|[Example](/examples/sitges-example.pdf)|Self-designed|

## Contribute
I encourage open-source lovers to implement their designs and to send a pull
request so we can all benefit from it. Always make sure that the code follows
the same structure and that it handles possible missing fields.
